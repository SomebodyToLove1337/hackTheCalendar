# HackTheCalendar - a Hack-Together project

## Updates your Out-of-Office-Auto-Replies automatically

This is a simple console application built using .NET v7.0 that connects to your calendar via Microsoft Graph, to determine if their are any out-of-office events scheduled. If so, the app will automatically update the AutomaticReplySettings of the user's mailbox to schedule an Out-Of-Office notice.
